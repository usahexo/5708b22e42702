# Lottery Winner Collects $100,000 Prize from Video Poker

When Joseph McAllister hit the jackpot on a video poker machine at the local casino, he thought it was a prank. But after listening to the casino staff congratulating him on his win and presenting him with a giant check for $100,000, he knew it was real.

"I just couldn't believe it," McAllister said in an interview shortly after pocketing his windfall. "I've played video poker before, but I've never won anything near this big."

McAllister says that he has no definite plans for what to do with the money yet, but he is definitely going to enjoy spending it. He is also considering taking a trip to see some of his relatives who live out of state.

In addition to the $100,000 prize from the casino, McAllister also collected another $10,000 from a separate progressive jackpot pot on the same machine. That brings his total take home from the lucky session to an even $110,000.

Video poker is one of the most popular casino games around and has been known to produce some life-changing payouts. In 2012, 25-year-old Jonathan Auch hit a Mega Millions video poker game at WinStar World Casino in Oklahoma for over $4 million. And in 2013, an unidentified gambler hit a $17 million jackpot playing Megabucks at The D Las Vegas casino in downtown Las Vegas.

# Man Takes Home Nearly $8,000 from Electronic Gaming Device

In a recent study, it was found that on average, men tend to take home significantly more money from electronic gaming devices than women. The study, which was carried out by researchers at the University of Alberta in Canada, found that men earn an average of $7,848 per year from electronic gaming, while women earn just $2,915 on average.

When the researchers looked at which type of gaming generated the most income for men and women, they found that men earn more from gambling games such as poker and blackjack, while women earn more from puzzle and strategy games such as Tetris and Candy Crush. However, it should be noted that these findings are not statistically significant, meaning that the difference between the amount of money earned by men and women may not be due to gender alone.

One possible explanation for these findings is that men are more likely to spend more time playing electronic games than women. In fact, the study found that men play for an average of 2 hours and 36 minutes per day, while women play for just 1 hour and 47 minutes per day. This difference in playing time could account for the discrepancy in income levels between men and women.

Overall, the study provides some interesting insights into how men and women differ when it comes to earning money from electronic gaming devices. It will be interesting to see if these differences persist in future studies.
