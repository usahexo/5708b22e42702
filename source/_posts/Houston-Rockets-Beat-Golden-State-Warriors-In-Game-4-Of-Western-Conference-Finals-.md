The Houston Rockets are one game away from punching their ticket to the NBA Finals.

In Tuesday night’s Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, James Harden and company defeated the Golden State Warriors 97-94. It was a closely contested matchup from start to finish, but the Rockets were able to pull out the win thanks to some clutch shooting from Harden late in the game.

Houston now holds a 3-1 series lead over Golden State and can clinch a spot in the NBA Finals with a win in Game 5 on Thursday night. But with Stephen Curry back in the fold for Golden State, it won’t be easy for Houston to close things out at home.

The Warriors got off to a hot start in Tuesday night’s game, taking an early 14-point lead. But Houston gradually chipped away at that lead throughout the course of the game, and they eventually took control in the fourth quarter.

Harden was once again spectacular for Houston, putting up 28 points on 10-of-27 shooting. Chris Paul also had a big game for the Rockets, finishing with 20 points and 11 assists. Clint Capela was another bright spot for Houston; he tallied 16 points and 14 rebounds.

For Golden State, Curry led the way with 34 points on 12-of-27 shooting. Klay Thompson added 23 points for Golden State, while Kevin Durant finished with 20 points and 10 rebounds.

#  Houston Rockets Edge Out Oklahoma City Thunder In Exciting Series

For the first time in the 2017 playoffs, the Houston Rockets were pushed to the brink of elimination. After dropping Games 3 and 4 at home, many fans and pundits alike had written off their chances of making a comeback against the Oklahoma City Thunder. However, led by MVP-candidate James Harden, the Rockets won Game 5 in thrilling fashion before closing out the series in Game 6 back in Houston.

The series was exciting from beginning to end, with both teams playing at a high level offensively. The Thunder appeared to have an edge early on, thanks in part to their domination on the boards; they averaged nearly 16 more rebounds per game than Houston. However, the Rockets' explosive offense was too much for Oklahoma City to handle, as they averaged over 116 points per game in the series.

Harden was obviously a key factor in Houston's success; he averaged 34.7 points, 8.3 assists, and 5.3 rebounds per game while shooting nearly 47% from beyond the arc. Chris Paul also played a big role for Houston, averaging 18.6 points and 7 assists per game while shooting 44% from three-point range.

The Thunder were led by superstar Russell Westbrook, who averaged a triple double (41 points, 10 rebounds, 10 assists) during the series. However, he was unable to carry his team to victory against a tough Rockets squad.

Houston will now move on to face either Golden State or San Antonio in the Western Conference Finals.
