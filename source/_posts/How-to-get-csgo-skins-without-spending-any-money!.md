Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO) is a first-person shooter video game developed by Valve Corporation. As in other games of the genre, players join either the terrorist team, or the counter-terrorist team, and attempt to complete objectives, such as planting or defending a bomb, rescuing hostages, or assassinating an enemy player.

The main attraction of CSGO skins is that they are cosmetic only and do not affect gameplay. This makes them purely decorative, which is great for people who want to customize their characters but don’t want to give up an edge in the game.
