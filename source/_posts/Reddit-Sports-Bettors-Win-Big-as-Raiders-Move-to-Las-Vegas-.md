#  Reddit Sports Bettors Win Big as Raiders Move to Las Vegas 

In a stunning turn of events, the NFL approved the relocation of the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas late Monday night. The news came as a major surprise to the sports world, with many expecting the franchise to instead be sold and moved elsewhere.

As one would expect, the announcement caused a flurry of action on Reddit’s sports betting subreddit, r/sportsbets. Bettors who had waited until the last minute to make their picks were rewarded with some lucrative payouts.

The most popular bet on Monday was taking the Raiders to win Super Bowl LIII. They were listed at odds of +4000 (40/1) before the move was announced, but those odds quickly shortened to just +2000 (20/1) once it became clear that the team was headed for Sin City.

Other bets that saw big payouts included taking the Raiders to win their division (+800), making them a Super Bowl contender (+550), and even simply betting on them to finish above .500 (+325).

#  Reddit sports bettors cash in as Las Vegas Raiders make playoffs 

For the first time in over a decade, the Oakland Raiders are headed to the playoffs. This comes as great news for Bay Area sports fans, but also for those who placed bets on the Raiders this season.

It’s no secret that the Raiders have been one of the most profitable teams to bet on in the NFL this year. According to Oddschecker, the team has had implied odds of making the playoffs of +280 (meaning if you put $100 on them to make the playoffs at any point during the season, you would have won $280).

As it turns out, many Redditors took advantage of these odds and placed bets on the Raiders throughout the year. In fact, a quick browse through some of the top posts from the /r/sportsbook subreddit reveals that many users netted healthy profits from betting on Oakland this season.

User /u/throw2thefishes, for example, report making a profit of over $1,600 by betting on the Raiders every week this season. Meanwhile, user /u/MoneyMovesOnly managed to turn a $500 bet into a profit of over $3,000. And user /u/JigsawPuzzleMan walked away with over $2,200 in profits after betting on Oakland all season long.

Needless to say, if you managed to bet on the Raiders this year, you did very well for yourself! With their trip to the playoffs now confirmed, there’s no doubt that Vegas sportsbooks will be forced to adjust their odds significantly for next season – so be sure to stay tuned for future updates.

#  Money poured into Reddit sports betting over Raiders move to Las Vegas 

For years there has been speculation that the Raiders would move to Las Vegas and on Monday that became a reality. The news was confirmed when the Raiders filed for relocation to Las Vegas with the NFL. This move has led to a lot of money being poured into sports betting, with the majority of it being put on the Raiders moving to Las Vegas.

As of Tuesday morning, Sportsbook.ag had the Raiders listed as a -650 favorite to make the move to Sin City. The next closest team was the Miami Dolphins who were at +1100. Bettors are obviously confident that the Raiders will be making the move and those who have placed bets are likely going to see some nice payouts if that does end up happening.

This is not the first time that money has been bet on an NFL team moving. Back in 2010 when it looked like the Rams were going to move from St. Louis to Los Angeles, over $1 million was wagered on that move. The Rams eventually stayed in St. Louis, but that didn't stop people from betting on them moving again in 2016 when they ended up moving to Los Angeles.

It will be interesting to see if this trend continues and more money is wagered on teams moving in the future. It's clear that people enjoy betting on these types of things and it will be interesting to see how much money is wagered on future moves now that there is a precedent set.

#  Fans down on Reddit sports betting now that Raiders are in Las Vegas 

One of the big things that NFL fans were looking forward to this season was how the relocation of the Oakland Raiders to Las Vegas would play out. There was a lot of discussion and debate on sports betting forums like Reddit about what this could mean for the team and their overall performance on the field.

Well, with the Raiders now 3-10 and pretty much out of playoff contention, some fans are starting to regret ever betting on them. One Redditor commented:

“I’ve lost so much money on the Raiders this year. I can’t believe I ever thought they’d be a good bet.”

Others have been venting their frustrations about how much money they’ve lost on the team, with many saying that they wish they had never gotten involved in sports betting at all.

Of course, there are still some fans who remain optimistic about the Raiders, but it seems that many are now regretting their decision to put money down on them. With just a few games left in the season, it will be interesting to see how this plays out – and whether or not any more bets are placed on the team.

#  Disappointed Reddit sports bettors turn to casino games

Las Vegas is seeing an influx of sports bettors who are looking for alternatives after getting burned by bets on the Super Bowl. Many of these people are turning to casino games, where they can still try to make some money off their losses.

There has been a noticeable increase in the number of people playing blackjack, roulette, and other casino games in the past few weeks. This is likely due to the fact that these games offer a lower house edge than betting on sports does.

Some people are even going so far as to learn how to play these games in order to improve their chances of winning. This is a risky proposition, but it could pay off if they are able to win enough money to cover their losses from the Super Bowl.

Making money at a casino is never easy, but it is definitely possible for those who are patient and willing to learn the rules. There are plenty of resources available online that can help you get started, so don't be afraid to give it a try.
