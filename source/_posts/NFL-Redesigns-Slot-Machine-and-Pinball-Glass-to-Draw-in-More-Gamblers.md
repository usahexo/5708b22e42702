# Things You'll Need

To make an NFL slot machine or pinball glass, you will need a few basic supplies. These supplies include:

- Glue Gun and Glue Sticks
- Cutting Tool (i.e. Scissors)
- Clear Glass Plate or Window Glass
- Printed Images of NFL Logos (or Other Patriotic Images)
- Paint (optional)
- Protective Coatings (optional)

 # Preparing Your Materials

The first step in making your NFL slot machine or pinball glass is to prepare your materials. This includes cutting out the images of NFL logos and other patriotic images. You can use scissors to do this, but a cutting tool such as a craft knife will work better. Be careful when cutting out these images, as you want them to be as accurate as possible.

Once you have cut out all of the images, it is time to start gluing them onto your clear glass plate or window glass. You can use a glue gun for this, but be sure to use caution when handling it as it gets hot. Apply a thin layer of glue to the back of each image and then press it firmly against the glass plate or window glass. Allow the glue to dry completely before moving on to the next step.
