#  What are the Chances of Receiving a Legendary From the Port Machine in Borderlands 2?

Borderlands 2 players who are looking to get their hands on a legendary item may be wondering what the chances are of receiving one from the port machine. The answer to this question may vary depending on the player, but there is no definitive answer.

Generally speaking, the chance of receiving a legendary from the port machine is fairly low. However, there are some things that players can do to increase their chances of getting lucky. Firstly, it is important to know that the port machine does not give out legendary items very often. Secondly, players can increase their chances by using rare materials in the production process. Finally, it is also helpful to have a high luck stat.

All things considered, receiving a legendary from the port machine in Borderlands 2 is not always a certainty. However, by taking into account all of the factors that influence this outcome, players can give themselves the best chance possible of getting lucky.

#  Borderlands 2: How Likely is it to Get a Legendary From the Machine?

Borderlands 2 is a great game that has been out for a while. It can be pretty frustrating when it seems like the loot you are getting from the machines is not very good. You may be wondering how likely it is to get a legendary from the machine.

The answer to that question really depends on how lucky you are. Some people seem to get a legendary every time they spin the machine, while others may never get one at all. There is no guarantee that you will get a legendary from the machine, but your chances are definitely better than if you were just randomly picking items up off of the ground.

If you are looking for a specific legendary, then your chances of getting it from the machine are even better. The odds of getting a specific legendary depend on how many of that particular legendary are in the game. For example, if there are only three shields in the game and you are looking for one in particular, then your odds of getting it from the machine are three in one hundred thousand.

While those odds may seem pretty low, they are actually much better than if you were just trying to find any shield at all. If you are looking for any shield, then your odds would be one in ten thousand. So, as you can see, your chances of getting a specific legendary from the machine are much higher than finding any other type of item.

If you want to increase your chances of getting a legendary even further, then there are some things that you can do. One thing you can do is save up your money until you have enough to buy multiple spins on the machine. This will give you more chances to get a legendary and increase your overall chances of getting one significantly.

Another thing that you can do is try to upgrade your gear as much as possible. The better gear that you have, the more likely it is that the next Legendary item that you get will be an upgrade for your character. Finally, make sure to keep checking back on the machine regularly. The best time to check is when new items have been added to the game because there is a greater chance of getting something good from the machine then.

#  Chances of Getting a Legendary From the Borderlands 2 Port Machine

There has been a lot of speculation on the chances of getting a legendary from the Borderlands 2 port machine in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Unfortunately, there is no definitive answer, as the odds of getting a legendary vary depending on your luck and other factors. Nevertheless, here are some tips to help increase your chances of getting that elusive legend.

The first step is to get yourself a good farming spot. One popular spot is Attikus and the Thrall Rebellion DLC, where you can farm X-STLK-23s for their unique weapon, the Shredifier. This gun has a high chance of dropping a legendary and will help you gear up quickly for endgame content.

Another good place to farm legendaries is in the Grinder, which can be accessed from the central hub in Concordia. Here, you can use rare and powerful weapons to grind out better gear. The downside to this method is that it can be very costly in terms of eridium, so make sure you have plenty saved up before diving in.

Finally, don’t forget about the port machine itself. While the odds of getting a legendary are not as good as in the Grinder, it’s still worth giving it a try if you have some spare eridium lying around. Just keep in mind that each attempt costs 5 eridium, so make sure you’re willing to spend if you want to increase your chances significantly.

#  What are the Chances of Getting a Legendary From the Borderlands 2 Port Machine?

The Borderlands 2 port machine is a new addition to the game that was released in May of 2019. This machine allows players to exchange their old legendaries for new ones, with a chance of getting a legendary. So, what are the chances of getting a legendary from the Borderlands 2 port machine?

The answer to this question is not entirely clear. However, players have reported receiving legendaries from the port machine at a rate of approximately 1 in 100. This means that, on average, players should expect to receive a legendary from the port machine after exchanging 100 old legendaries.

While it is possible to get lucky and receive a legendary after exchanging fewer than 100 old legendaries, it is also possible to exchange more than 100 old legendaries without receiving a legendary. Therefore, it is important for players to be patient and continue exchanging old legendaries until they receive the legendary they are hoping for.

#  Borderlands 2: The Chances of Getting a Legendary From the Port Machine

Borderlands 2 has been out for a few years now and there are still people trying to get their hands on those sweet, sweet legendaries. The port machine in Sanctuary is the place to go if you want to try your luck, but what are the chances of actually getting one?

Well, it honestly depends on what you’re looking for. The odds of getting a specific legendary are relatively low, but the odds of getting a legendary in general are much higher. Here’s a breakdown of the chances, according to an article on SegmentNext:

• For a specific legendary, the odds are 1 in 10,000

• For any legendary, the odds are 1 in 1,000

• For a unique legendary (not including Seraph gear), the odds are 1 in 100

As you can see, your best bet is to try for any legendary rather than a specific one. And if you’re really lucky, you might even snag a unique one!
