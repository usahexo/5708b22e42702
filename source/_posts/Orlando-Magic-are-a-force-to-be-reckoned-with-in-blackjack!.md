# 5. Blackjack is definitely not just for experts – the Orlando Magic have shown that anyone can play and win.

This past year, the Orlando Magic made a bit of a splash in the NBA world when they managed to make it all the way to the playoffs. Many people were surprised at their success, especially because they are not considered one of the stronger teams in the league.

Interestingly, though, if you take a closer look at the way they play, you’ll see that their strategy is actually based on blackjack principles. In fact, head coach Steve Clifford even implemented a blackjack-style betting system for his team.

The way this system works is that each player is given an allotment of “bets” at the beginning of each game. They can then choose to use these bets however they want – either by betting on themselves to win or by betting on their opponents.

The beauty of this system is that it allows players to be more flexible with their bets. It also encourages them to take risks and gamble a bit more – something that can often lead to success in blackjack (and in other casino games).

The Orlando Magic aren’t the only ones who have used blackjack principles to improve their game. In fact, many professional sports teams have been doing it for years. The New England Patriots are one such team, and they credit their success in part to the blackjack strategy they use.

So if you’re looking for a way to up your game and improve your chances of winning, give blackjack a try! You may be surprised at how well you can do.
