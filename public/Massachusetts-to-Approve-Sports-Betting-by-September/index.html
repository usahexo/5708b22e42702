        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Massachusetts-to-Approve-Sports-Betting-by-September"><a href="#Massachusetts-to-Approve-Sports-Betting-by-September" class="headerlink" title="Massachusetts to Approve Sports Betting by September?"></a>Massachusetts to Approve Sports Betting by September?</h1><p>In early July, the state of Massachusetts took a step closer to approve sports betting by signing a memorandum of understanding with DraftKings. The memorandum outlines the regulatory structure for sports betting in the state and how it will be implemented.</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Gaming Commission must still approve the regulations, but that is seen as a formality at this point. It’s anticipated that regulations will be approved by September and that sports betting could be operational in Massachusetts by the end of the year.</p>
<p>This is great news for DraftKings, which already has a strong presence in Massachusetts and is well-positioned to become one of the leading operators in the state’s sports betting market.</p>
<p>There are still some unanswered questions about how sports betting will be rolled out in Massachusetts, including what specific types of bets will be available and what taxes will apply. But with regulations moving closer to approval, we should have more clarity on these issues soon.</p>
<p>Assuming everything goes according to plan, it looks like Massachusetts will be one of the first states to offer legal sports betting in 2019. This is good news for those who live in Massachusetts, as well as for DraftKings, which looks poised to take advantage of this new market opportunity.</p>
<h1 id="Massachusetts-Gaming-Commission-Plans-to-Finalize-Regulations-for-Sports-Betting-by-September"><a href="#Massachusetts-Gaming-Commission-Plans-to-Finalize-Regulations-for-Sports-Betting-by-September" class="headerlink" title="Massachusetts Gaming Commission Plans to Finalize Regulations for Sports Betting by September"></a>Massachusetts Gaming Commission Plans to Finalize Regulations for Sports Betting by September</h1><p>The date was set: September. That’s when the Massachusetts Gaming Commission plans to finalize its regulations for sports betting, in anticipation of the activity becoming legal in the state soon thereafter.</p>
<p>In a meeting last week, the five-member commission gave an update on their work to develop rules around sports betting. MGM Springfield, which has been tapped to lead one of three proposed gaming resorts in Massachusetts, showed its interest in getting into the market.</p>
<p>“MGM is committed to providing an incredible experience for our guests and are looking forward to offering this new form of entertainment when it becomes available in Massachusetts,” said MGM Springfield president Michael Mathis.</p>
<p>The development comes as several other states have already legalized some form of sports betting, including New Jersey, Delaware, Mississippi, and West Virginia. Penn National Gaming – which owns a casino in Plainville, MA – has already announced plans to offer sports betting at its properties when it becomes legal in the state.</p>
<p>Regulations for online sports betting have not yet been released, but it is expected that they will be different from those for land-based casinos. The commission plans to hold a hearing on July 19th to receive input from the public on the proposed regulations.</p>
<h1 id="Massachusetts-Looks-Likely-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-the-Coming-Months"><a href="#Massachusetts-Looks-Likely-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-the-Coming-Months" class="headerlink" title="Massachusetts Looks Likely to Legalize Sports Betting in the Coming Months"></a>Massachusetts Looks Likely to Legalize Sports Betting in the Coming Months</h1><p>A recent opinion poll suggests that more than 60 percent of Massachusetts residents support legalizing sports betting. This could be great news for the state, as it looks likely to legalize the activity in the coming months.</p>
<p>There are a few key reasons why legalizing sports betting could be a good move for Massachusetts. First,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> it would provide much-needed revenue for the state government. In fact, some estimates suggest that legalizing sports betting could bring in up to $80 million in revenue each year. Second, it would create jobs and support local businesses. Finally, it would give residents a new way to enjoy sporting events.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been any major opposition to legalizing sports betting in Massachusetts. In fact, many lawmakers seem to be in favor of the idea. One of the biggest obstacles facing legalization is likely to be getting approval from the National Football League (NFL). The NFL has been a vocal opponent of legalized sports betting and is likely to fight any attempt to legalize it in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Despite this potential obstacle, it seems likely that sports betting will be legalized in Massachusetts in the near future. This would make it the fourth state in New England to legalize sports betting, joining Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Maine.</p>
<h1 id="Massachusetts-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Early-Fall"><a href="#Massachusetts-Poised-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting-in-Early-Fall" class="headerlink" title="Massachusetts Poised to Legalize Sports Betting in Early Fall"></a>Massachusetts Poised to Legalize Sports Betting in Early Fall</h1><p>Governor Charlie Baker and the Massachusetts state legislature are close to a deal that will legalize sports betting in the Bay State, likely sometime this fall. The deal would give the state’s two racetracks - Suffolk Downs in Boston and Plainridge Park Casino in Plainville - the first crack at sports betting licenses.</p>
<p>The move would make Massachusetts the seventh state to legalizing sports betting since the US Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May. New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Mississippi and Rhode Island have all since moved to legalize some form of sports betting.</p>
<p>“We’re hopeful we can get something done this session,” said Jennifer Flanagan, a Democratic state senator who chairs the Joint Committee on Gaming and Wagering. Baker, a Republican, has also voiced support for legalizing sports betting.</p>
<p>Under the proposed deal, the two tracks would be able to offer various forms of sports betting, including online and mobile wagering as well as in-person bets at their racebooks and other designated areas. The tracks would pay a licensing fee of $200,000 each, and would be required to contribute 5% of their annual gross gaming revenue to problem gambling prevention and treatment programs.</p>
<p>The proposal still needs approval from both chambers of the legislature before it heads to Governor Baker’s desk for his signature.</p>
<h1 id="Rumors-Swirl-that-Massachusetts-Is-Close-to-Legalizing-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Rumors-Swirl-that-Massachusetts-Is-Close-to-Legalizing-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Rumors Swirl that Massachusetts Is Close to Legalizing Sports Betting"></a>Rumors Swirl that Massachusetts Is Close to Legalizing Sports Betting</h1><p>There has been a lot of talk recently about the potential for sports betting to be legalized in Massachusetts. The state is close to finalizing a deal that would allow casinos in the area to offer sports betting, though there are still some details that need to be worked out.</p>
<p>If this deal goes through, it would mark a big change for Massachusetts, which has traditionally been opposed to legalized gambling. However, it seems like attitudes are starting to shift, and there is growing support for sports betting as a way to generate revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and other problems, but supporters say that it can be regulated effectively and can provide a boost to the economy. It will be interesting to see how this debate plays out in Massachusetts and whether or not sports betting is eventually legalized.</p>
