#  How to Win at Roulette: BetCity Edition

Roulette is a casino game that’s been around for centuries. Its popularity means that just about every casino has it on offer, so there’s plenty of opportunity to take advantage of its quirks and beat the house.

The first step to winning at roulette is understanding the different types of bets you can make. In European roulette there are 36 numbers on the wheel and you can bet on any one number, as well as combinations of numbers. American roulette wheels have an extra number (0) meaning there are 38 possible betting options in total.

There are three basic kinds of bets in roulette: Outside bets, Inside bets and Neighbour bets. Outside bets are those placed on the perimeter of the betting table and include red or black, odd or even, high or low. Inside bets are those placed on specific numbers or groups of numbers, while Neighbour bets are wagers placed on a number with neighbouring numbers.

Learning which betting options offer the best odds is key to becoming a winning roulette player. The most favourable odds are available when betting on red or black – these pay out 1:1 if you win, so your chances of winning are 50/50. Odd/even, high/low and 1-18/19-36 all have odds of 2:1, meaning you’ll win twice your stake for every successful bet. Neighbour bets generally offer worse odds than outside bets but they can be more fun – particularly if you go for a risky combination!

Once you’ve got to grips with the different types of bet available, the next step is to learn some strategy. One tried-and-tested strategy is called ‘d’Alembert’ and it involves increasing your stakes when you lose and reducing them when you win. This system aims to even out your wins and losses in the long run so that over time your profits outweigh your losses. However, it’s important to remember that no system is foolproof – roulette is a game of chance after all!

If you want to increase your chances of winning even further, one thing you can do is choose a reputable online casino like BetCity where games are fair and payout rates are high. BetCity offers players a wide variety of roulette games, as well as generous bonuses and promotions that give players an edge over the house. So why not try your hand at Roulette today?

Roulette is a casino game that has been around for centuries. The goal of the game is to guess where the ball will end up after spinning around a wheel. There are many different ways to bet on roulette, and each offers its own set of risks and rewards.

The first step to winning at roulette is understanding the different types of bets you can make. There are three main categories: inside bets, outside bets, and combination bets.

Inside bets are those that are placed on specific numbers or groups of numbers. They offer high payouts but also have the highest risk.
