#  Miami Dolphins get a boost with addition of 'ante'

The Miami Dolphins get a much-needed boost in their playoff chances with the signing of veteran quarterback Tom Brady's cousin, 'ante' Brady.

Coach Adam Gase says that 'ante' has a "strong arm and he is very accurate with his throws." The addition of 'ante' to the team should help take some of the pressure off starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill.

Quarterback is not the only position where the Dolphins have made an addition; they have also signed defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul. Pierre-Paul is coming off an injury-plagued season but is still one of the most feared pass rushers in the NFL.

The Dolphins will need all the help they can get as they are currently in a tight battle for a playoff spot in the AFC. With three games remaining in the regular season, they are currently in second place in the AFC East, just behind the New England Patriots.

If they can manage to win their last three games, they will make it to the playoffs for the first time since 2016.

#  Ante up: Miami Dolphins prepare for new season

The Miami Dolphins are coming off a season where they finished 10-6 and made the playoffs for the first time in 10 years. The offseason has been one of change, with the team letting go of or trading away some of their biggest names, such as Jarvis Landry, Jay Ajayi, Ndamukong Suh, and Mike Pouncey.

The team is clearly preparing for a rebuild and is looking towards the future. One of the newest additions to the team is Pro Bowl receiver Danny Amendola, who signed a two-year contract with the Dolphins in March.

Many experts are predicting that the Dolphins will finish .500 or worse this season, but coach Adam Gase is not listening to any of that noise. "We're trying to win a championship," Gase said at a press conference on Wednesday. "We're not tanking this thing."

 Quarterback Ryan Tannehill echoed his coach's sentiments, saying that he's ready to lead this team to victory. "I'm excited about this year," Tannehill said. "I feel like we have a lot of talent on this team and we can do something special."

The team will open their preseason schedule against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Thursday night.

#  Poker strategy crucial as Miami Dolphins ante up

The Miami Dolphins announced they were in the market for a new quarterback this offseason, and rumors are swirling as to who they will choose. The team is said to be interested in both Colin Kaepernick and Jay Cutler.

Kaepernick is a polarizing player who has had a successful career but is currently unsigned after opting out of his contract with the San Francisco 49ers. Cutler, on the other hand, is a more traditional option. He has been a starter in the NFL for 10 seasons and played for the Chicago Bears for eight of those.

Poker strategy can give us some insight into which player the Dolphins may choose. In poker, there are two main types of hands: strong and weak. A strong hand is one that is likely to win if it goes to showdown, while a weak hand is one that is likely to lose if it goes to showdown.

In order to make a decision about which hand to play, you need to know your opponent's range of hands. Your opponent's range consists of all the hands he or she could possibly have at any given point in the game.

When playing against an inexperienced opponent, you can assume that they will have weaker hands more often than stronger hands. This means you should play more aggressively against them when you have a strong hand and take a more conservative approach when you have a weak hand.

When playing against an experienced opponent, however, you need to assume that they will have stronger hands more often than weaker hands. This means you should play more conservatively against them when you have a strong hand and take an aggressive approach when you have a weak hand.

So which type of quarterback does the Miami Dolphins have? An inexperienced quarterback or an experienced quarterback? It's difficult to say without knowing more about the team's personnel, but we can make some general assumptions based on the type of quarterback they are interested in signing.

If they are interested in Kaepernick, then it's safe to assume they are looking for an inexperienced quarterback because Kaepernick falls into the category of players who are more likely to have stronger hands than weaker hands. On the other hand, if they are interested in Cutler, then it's safe to assume they are looking for an experienced quarterback because Cutler falls into the category of players who are more likely to have weaker hands than stronger hands.

#  Miami Dolphins set to ante up in AFC East

The Miami Dolphins have had a busy offseason, making a number of high-profile acquisitions that are sure to turn heads in the AFC East. With quarterback Ryan Tannehill under center, the Dolphins are looking to make a playoff push in 2018.

Here are some of the biggest moves made by Miami this offseason:

-Traded for wide receiver Danny Amendola and two draft picks from the New England Patriots

-Signed former Minnesota Vikings running back Latavius Murray

-Re-signed safety Michael Thomas

-Signed defensive tackle Akeem Spence and cornerback Bobby McCain

These moves have many pundits believing that the Dolphins are poised to dethrone the New England Patriots as kings of the AFC East. While it may be too early to say with certainty, there is no doubt that Miami is heading into the season with a lot of momentum.

With Amendola, Murray and Kenny Stills leading the way at receiver, Tannehill should have no trouble finding targets downfield. And with Ndamukong Suh now in Los Angeles, Spence and McCain will be tasked with stuffing the run up front.

It remains to be seen if Miami can live up to the hype, but one thing is for sure: The Dolphins are going to be one of the most intriguing teams to watch in 2018.

#  Miami Dolphins ready to ante up and take on the competition

After a lackluster finish to the 2017-2018 season, the Miami Dolphins have been quietly preparing to take on any challengers in the upcoming NFL season. In an interview with the team's owner, Stephen Ross, he stated that they are committed to winning and will do what it takes to improve the team.

This offseason, they made some key acquisitions, including tight end Mike Gesicki from Penn State and running back Frank Gore from the Indianapolis Colts. They also drafted Minkah Fitzpatrick from Alabama, who is expected to make an immediate impact on defense.

The biggest challenge for the Dolphins this year is likely to be their division rivals, the New England Patriots. The Patriots have been dominant in recent years, but there is hope that the Dolphins can give them a good run for their money this season.

It remains to be seen whether they will be able to pull off an upset against the Patriots, but one thing is for sure - they are definitely not going to back down from a challenge.
