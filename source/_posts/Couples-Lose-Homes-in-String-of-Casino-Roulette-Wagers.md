#  Couples Lose Homes in String of Casino Roulette Wagers

In the past month, six couples have lost their homes in a string of casino roulette wagers. The most recent was a family of four in Missouri who lost their home after betting their last $US2,000 on red at the Ameristar Casino in St. Charles.

The family joins five other couples in the past month who have also lost their homes while gambling at casinos across the United States. Four of those couples were playing blackjack, while one was playing poker and another was playing roulette.

Regardless of game, most of these couples were convinced that they could beat the house by employing a simple betting strategy: doubling down on hot hands or splitting pairs. Unfortunately for them, casino odds are always in favour of the house, no matter how “hot” your hand may be.

For many of these losing couples, going home empty-handed was preferable to continuing to lose money and risking eviction or bankruptcy. But for others, the lure of potential riches was just too great to resist – even if it meant mortgaging their homes and putting everything at risk.

#  Gambling Addiction Costs Men and Women Homes

Gambling addiction can have a devastating effect on one's life. It can lead to job loss, financial ruin, and even homelessness. The National Council on Problem Gambling reports that about two-thirds of people who have a gambling addiction are men, while the other third are women.

There are several reasons why men are more likely to develop a gambling addiction than women. Some experts believe that men are more likely to be thrill seekers and risk takers than women. They may also be more likely to seek out gambling opportunities because they see it as a way to make easy money.

The fact that gambling is legal in many places also contributes to the problem. People can easily access casinos, racetracks, and other gambling venues, which makes it difficult for them to resist the temptation to gamble.

Gambling addiction can have a serious impact on one's life. In addition to causing financial problems, it can also lead to marital problems and family strife. Children of parents with a gambling addiction are often affected by the addiction as well. They may feel ashamed of their parents' behavior or feel like they have to take care of them.

Despite the negative consequences of gambling addiction, there is help available for those who need it. There are support groups available for both men and women, and there are also rehab programs that can help people overcome their addiction. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, please seek help from a qualified professional.

#  Woman Loses House After Gambling at Casino Roulette

A woman in her early 20s has lost her house after gambling at a casino roulette table. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, says that she was encouraged to gamble by casino staff and ended up losing everything she owned.

“It was my birthday and I’d been saving up for months to go to the casino,” the woman said. “I’d never gambled before, but the staff were really friendly and encouraging. I started off playing roulette and it seemed easy enough. But then things started going wrong and before I knew it, I’d lost my house. It’s all gone.”

The woman is now living on the streets, begging for money to buy food. She says that she has contacted the police and hopes to get her money back from the casino, but knows that this will be difficult.

The case serves as a warning to other gamblers, especially those who are new to the game. Roulette can be very addictive and before you know it, you could find yourself in a similar position as this woman. If you do choose to gamble, always do so responsibly and never gamble more than you can afford to lose.

#  Couple Gamble and Lose Home in Casino Roulette

For many people, gambling is nothing more than a fun pastime. But for some, it can be a dangerous addiction that leads to ruin. This was the case for a couple in England who lost their home after betting everything they had on a game of casino roulette.

The husband and wife, who were not identified, had been playing roulette at their local casino for several hours when they decided to up the stakes and bet their home on a single spin of the wheel. Unfortunately for them, they lost, and were left with no choice but to sell their home and move out.

While this may seem like an extreme case, it is unfortunately not unique. Many people have lost everything they own by gambling away their money in casinos or on online betting sites. So if you're thinking about gambling, be sure to do your research first and know what you're getting into. Otherwise, you could end up like the English couple – homeless and penniless.
